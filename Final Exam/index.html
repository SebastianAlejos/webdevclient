            <p>For those of you who are going on to the next Web Development course, prepare to learn from a fire
                hydrant. You will use
                what you have learned in this course and much, more. We will learn a lot including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> <b>PHP</b>. PHP originally stood for "Personal Home Page" but when it was re-written, it was
                    renamed "PHP:
                    Hypertext
                    Preprocessor." That's right, PHP has PHP as part of it's acronym...that's recursion.</li>
                <li><b>javascript.</b> This course will do more with validation and Ajax.</li>
                <li><b>SQL.</b>, which stands for Structured Query Language, is a language that allows you to access
                    databases.
                    We will be
                    learning enough to do some basic queries against a database.</li>
