        Tea is a big business in Africa, with Kenya being one of the four largest tea producing countries in the world.
        Africa has a variety of teas ranging from black tea, rooibos, honey bush, moringa tea, chamomile and many more
        native teas. Some of the teas do not come from the Camellia sinensis tree, they are herbal infused teas most of
        which are used for medicinal purposes.

        <h2>Kenya <img class="right" src="https://cdn.britannica.com/15/15-004-B5D6BF80/Flag-Kenya.jpg" width="50"

        </h2>
        <p>
            Kenya is the largest tea producing country in Africa and, “It’s right on the equator, which means teas are
            produced
            all year long and are non-seasonal” (Source: <a
                href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/07/17/africa/africa-tea-traditions">CNN</a>).
            They are well known for their black tea but recently they are mass producing a new kind of tea called purple
            tea.
            Purple tea brews up a light, reddish-purple color, and has a mellow flavor similar to that of oolong.
            Purple tea is naturally extremely high in antioxidants and anthocyanins, and is also very low in caffeine.

        <h2>Malawi <img class="right" width="50" src="https://cdn.britannica.com/21/4221-004-F69BA876/Flag-Malawi.jpg"

        </h2>
        <p>
            When we talk about tea in Africa Malawi should be put in the equation because they house the oldest tea
            plantations in Africa, “with some bushes dating back to the 19th century..., Malawian teas are richer and
            deeper
            than those produced from Kenya.” (Source: <a
                href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/07/17/africa/africa-tea-traditions/index.html">CNN</a>).
            They produce mostly white, green and even oolong tea and they are the second largest tea producers in
            Africa.

    <div id="southAfrica">
        <h2>South Africa <img class="right" src="https://cdn.britannica.com/27/4227-004-B2E23E61/Flag-South-Africa.jpg"
                alt="South Africa" width="50">
        </h2>
        <p>
            South Africa is popularly known for its rooibos tea. Rooibos does not come from the tea tree but from a
            herb.
            It is therefore caffeine free but to add that hint of caffeine some people mix it with green tea or black
            tea.
            Honeybush is another popular tea in South Africa. Both of these teas are rich in tannins, and rich in
            antioxidants.
            Rooibos is native to the Cederberg, a small mountainous region in South Africa’s Western Cape.

            “Egypt is one of the largest exporters of chamomile tea today, producing sweet, full-flowered chamomile of
            exceptional quality.” (Source: <a href="https://www.artfultea.com/tea-wisdom-1/african-teas">Artful

        </h2>
        <p>
            If you have not tried Moroccan mint tea, you are missing out. Tea is not produced in Morocco but the blend
            of the
            Chinese gunpowder tea and the Moroccan mint produces something divine.
