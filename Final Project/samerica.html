            <h2>History of Yerba Mate</h2>
            <p>The history of Yerba Mate can be traced back to the semi-nomadic Guarani people of southern Brazil,
                northern Argentina and Paraguay. Legend has it that the Guarani believe the yerba mate tree to be a gift
                given to a group of weary travelers by a benevolent god as a reward for their righteousness. This legend
                eventually carried on giving yerba mate tea its “Drink of the Gods” nickname. The Guarani were said to
                use yerba mate as a daily tonic for health. Even today it continues to be a daily habit of the people
                now living in this area. Yerba mate also became a central part of their system of medicine and healing.
                Today, plantation cultivation of yerba mate continues in parts of Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and
                Paraguay.
